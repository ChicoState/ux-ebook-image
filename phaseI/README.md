# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
The problem Ebook Image Grayscaler aims to solve is twofold. When books are ported to an Ebook format, there exists ways in which the port is handled poorly which might result in a larger than necessary storage footprints, or unwanted color information. While being able to solve this storage footprint is admirable, in handling the color information it's possible to also assist in helping create accessible Ebooks. By taking into account vision impairment and colorblind profiles, potential users are given the choice that empowers their needs. During this first phase of the project, work is primarily being done on color conversions as well as competitors in the space of compression and color converting of Ebooks. 

## Methods
<!-- !!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!! -->
<!-- Competitive analysis -->
Research was conducted via several key methods. First was a competitive analysis of relevant competitors in the same or tangential related field of Ebook management. These included products ranging widely in usage and adoption from Calibre, a defacto open source Ebook management software, to Adobe Digital Editions, A large library access point on mobile devices. We found a common trend across all these competitors was a lack of polished UI, and subscription or freemium services. Another key point was the lack of device compatibility, not many of these applications targeted all modern devices. Our research in this method also yielded a typical demographic of scholars, E-Book device users, and book archivists as well as comic readers. 

<!-- heuristic evaluation  -->
Our second research was conducted using a Heuristic Evaluation on a subset of the aforementioned competitors. This method focused on Calibre and took note of its strengths and weaknesses. Downloading the application for ourselves and taking a closer look at its features using the ten usability heuristics as a guide for evaluation. In general Calibre suffered from a shocking lack of feedback for the user, and poor UI polish. In particular the application did not fare very well in error prevention as during the evaluation, several errors occurred attempting to use basic features. Instead of using standard interfaces, Calibre opts for a table style to access books which felt dated among todays easily accessible cloud storage interfaces. One thing it did perform well in was user control and freedom. At the expense of potentially overwhelming a novice user, many options are available from a single right click or menu.

<!-- Persona studies -->
Finally our last approach to researching was via the use of Persona studies. Our team had crafted 3 different personas representing the target demographic of our product. This yielded the results relevant to our presumed targeted demographics. We found that users want to save money, and keep ebooks centralized. Users also want to maybe publish and archive books as well, also circling back around to making money. Accessibility was not as prevalent here but we found a use case in which authors could provide accessibility options for books published online.

## Findings
!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
<!-- !!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!! -->
One caveat that should be noted is that with no real user data of our own, the information provided here is merely an estimate given the current landscape of the competitive space. Another noteworthy caveat is that the product space as is, is incredibly small. Very few competitors actually perform accessibility changes or compression on Ebooks, as such we've had to expand our scope to include those tangentially related to fill gaps required for a comprehensive competitive analysis.
