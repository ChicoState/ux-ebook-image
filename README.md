# EBook Image Grayscaler

EBook Image Grayscaler is a modern attempt to solve an old problem. EBooks are gaining traction over traditional books and with this new rise in information come with it a rise in storage consumption and a neglect for underrepresented vision impaired users. EBook Image aims to tackle both of these issues by providing a one stop shop for eBook compression and accessibility settings. As traditional books are haphazardly converted over to a modern format, their heavy colorful footprint should be a choice not a burden.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* User research showed crucial points that competitors missed:
  - Updates informing the user on progress towards their goal
  - User error recognition and recovery should be quick and simple
  - Few clicks, should be a simple process to reach a simple goal

* Analysis of user data provides focuses for maximizing user experience:
  - Well-organized collection of books that have been ran through the software
  - Efficient file processing for larger texts (textbooks, almanacs)

* Sketches illustrate ideas:
  - Minimal text to save user time
  - Few options to focus on achieving user's goals

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* Informal feedback outlined user needs for a more complete product:
  - Progression into a comprehensive **eBook manager**
  - Previous focus on compression instead becomes a feature
  - Opens/displays eBooks along with options for compression, file conversion
  
* Cognitive walkthroughs clarified users' thought process while interacting with the application:
  - Minimizing the number of choices **guides the user** to their goal
  - **Frequent feedback** makes clear the current status of a process
  - Prevent the need for searching for what to do next

* Wireframes realize plans for layout:
  - **Grouping** buttons with similar functionalities (compression, file type conversion)
  - Limiting additional features to a small space for **focus on eBook display**

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

* Prototype development brought design plans to life
  - Simple layout makes tasks trivial
  - Small number of distinct features enables linear paths with minimal choices

* User testing gives valuable insight on future software improvements:
  - **Layout decisions** that are currently in place make the software **satisfying** and **effective**
  - Not enough **feedback** to clarify the outcome of certain user tasks
