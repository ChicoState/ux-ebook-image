# EBook Image Grayscaler

Ebook image grayscaler is an modern attempt to solve an old problem. Ebooks are gaining traction over traditional books and with this new rise in information come with it a rise in storage consumption and a neglect for underrepresented vision impaired users. Ebook image aims to tackle both of these issues by providing a one stop shop for ebook compression and accessibility settings. As traditional books are haphazardly converted over to a modern format, their heavy colorful footprint should be a choice not a burden.
