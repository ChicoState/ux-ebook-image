# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!
With a clear identity/purpose defined for our software, the next goal was to get real potential users to experience the software. We developed a working prototype and ran user tests where subjects interacted with the prototype and gave their thoughts on how effective, efficient, and satisfying it felt to use.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

Our set of subjects for user testing led us to two primary conclusions. First of all, none of them had really any problems with the main page's layout and felt they knew where to look for everything. The one exception to this is that some people did not immediately recognize that for nearly all of the functionalities, they first had to select a book which was going to act as the target for that functionality. For example, for the "compress book" button, users would first have to click the book then the button, but a few did it in the reverse order. We  plan to add something to make this more clear. Also, our prototype was lacking in feedback, a couple of the tasks did not make it clear when they were completed. This was probably more of an oversight when designing our prototype than a design decision, but it was proven just how important that feedback is when a task is completed/completing.

## Caveats

The only major limitation we came across was related to our user testing. The subjects of our user testing were all students of a Usability Engineering course, which means they likely understand the concepts more than the average user, and may behave differently throughout testing than randomly selected test subjects would.
