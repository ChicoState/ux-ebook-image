# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Ebook-image aims to make it easier to convert your digital book libraries into different file formats and allows you to grayscale books to reduce bloated file sizes. This lets users spend less time moving between platforms to open odd file formats and convert them to more conventional formats in order to spend more time reading and less time searching for conversion tools.

With a clear identity/purpose defined for our software, the next goal was to get real potential users to experience the software. We developed a working prototype and ran user tests where subjects interacted with the prototype and gave their thoughts on how effective, efficient, and satisfying it felt to use.

## Methods

The primary method utilized in our research was a usability study, designed and aimed towards rigorously evaluating our prototype by taking into account the direct experiences and feedback from our test users. Upon completion of our designated tasks, users were asked to rate their experience on an arbitrary scale and provide open-ended feedback regarding their experiences with the prototype, such as their impressions, difficulties encountered whilst using the prototype, and suggestions for how we could improve the prototype. This usability study allowed us to get both quantitative and qualitative data which gave us insight into the understanding of user experiences with the prototype, and will help inform our subsequent prototyping in the future.

* Task 1: The purpose of this task was to simulate the process of a user trying to reduce the bloated file sizes of their school textbooks to assist with a storage problem. The goal is to see how users navigate the interface and how long it takes them to compress a file format into something smaller.
* Task 2: The purpose of this task is to determine how simple it is to add a new textbook to your existing library regardless of its format to be able to view your digital library all in one place. The goal of this task is to gauge how intuitive it was to add a new book to your digital library.
* Task 3: The purpose of this task is to gain insight on how easy users are able to share their favorite textbooks with their friends on other social media platforms with minimal effort. The goal of this task is to see how easy sharing books to other platforms is for our users.
* Task 4: The purpose of this task is to be able to convert books from one file format to another all in one place with minimal ease. The goal of this task is to see how users interact with the interface to convert one book’s file format into another file format.

## Findings

* Task 1: All test users were able to successfully reduce the size of their textbook files to assist with storage problems. All users accomplished this task within 10 seconds of reading the task out. This task was unanimously rated at 5 for ‘Very Easy’. However, some users did mention that having to select a book before selecting the convert button was odd as they expected to be able to select a book within the menu itself, not beforehand.
* Task 2: All test users were able to successfully add a new book to their library so they could access them in one place. This task was also completed within 10 seconds. All users rated this task at a 5 for ‘Very Easy’ as the interface was easy to use. However, a common trend we noticed was that users mentioned there was a lack of feedback after adding a book to your library. The book would display on the homepage with the other textbooks in your library, but there was no indicator suggesting that the addition was successful if you didn’t already know what book you were trying to add.
* Task 3: All users were able to successfully share their favorite copy of the book ‘Beginning Python for Programmers’ to their Reddit and Discord accounts. All users completed this task within 15 seconds and rated the task as Very Easy. None of our users found the interface frustrating to use and stated that the interface was intuitive and easy to use.
* Task 4: All users were able to successfully convert and export a book to another file format. Our users completed this task within 20 seconds and rated this task at a 3 for neutral. After the fact, we realized that this task was not well designed. Due to the prototype being in a simple state, there were no options to specify what file format you wanted to convert to or what file format your original book even was. These file formats were crucial for understanding if the process was done and we were missing this component. Instead, we provided a screen saying the conversion was done, but there was no detailed explanation of what exactly was done. Therefore, our users found this task very confusing and suggested that this interface be improved to include file formats.

## Conclusions

Our set of subjects for user testing led us to two primary conclusions. First of all, none of them had really any problems with the main page's layout and felt they knew where to look for everything. The one exception to this is that some people did not immediately recognize that for nearly all of the functionalities, they first had to select a book which was going to act as the target for that functionality. For example, for the "compress book" button, users would first have to click the book then the button, but a few did it in the reverse order. We  plan to add something to make this more clear. Also, our prototype was lacking in feedback, a couple of the tasks did not make it clear when they were completed. This was probably more of an oversight when designing our prototype than a design decision, but it was proven just how important that feedback is when a task is completed/completing.

## Caveats

The only major limitation we came across was related to our user testing. The subjects of our user testing were all students of a Usability Engineering course, which means they likely understand the concepts more than the average user, and may behave differently throughout testing than randomly selected test subjects would.
