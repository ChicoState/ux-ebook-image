# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!
With a clear identity/purpose defined for our software, the next goal was to get real potential users to experience the software. We developed a working prototype and ran user tests where subjects interacted with the prototype and gave their thoughts on how effective, efficient, and satisfying it felt to use.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

The only major limitation we came across was related to our user testing. The subjects of our user testing were all students of a Usability Engineering course, which means they likely understand the concepts more than the average user, and may behave differently throughout testing than randomly selected test subjects would.
