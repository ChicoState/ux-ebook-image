# Wireframes

### Revised wireframes
Initial wireframes were deemed lacking and confusing. For this reason we've revised the original wireframes to allow for a simpler design, where the views aren't drastically changed and usage of icons + Text to help users easily find functions they're looking for.  

#### Home Page
![Home](/wireframes/Home.png)
The homepage now shows books in a sliding window and shows them larger as most of the time users will be interacting with these books. The buttons above that aren't add book, require a book to be selected first.


#### Add Book
![AddBook](/wireframes/Addbook%20Modal.png)
Adding a book brings up a modal which allows the user to drag and drop onto the the designated whitespace area. There is also a browse button to bring up a native file explorer. Should the user not wish to add a book, a cancel button is added to remove the modal and return to the original state.


#### Convert Book

After selecting a book and pressing convert, a conversion modal appears. Information contained will be different conversion types to select from and the resulting conversion file properties.


#### Compress Book

Compression operates largely the same as conversion, with resulting information being displayed.
